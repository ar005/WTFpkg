description: "When pip installs or builds a package through a legacy setuptools path, it may execute the package's setup.py file using the installing user's privileges. This allows an attacker to embed arbitrary Python code in setup.py that runs during build or installation, with no sandboxing beyond whatever isolation the user provides. The executed code has access to the filesystem, environment variables, network, and any resources available to the user running pip. This remains a fundamental attack vector for legacy source-distribution workflows in the Python packaging ecosystem.<sup><a href=\"#hist-1\">[1]</a></sup>"
prerequisites:
  - "Victim installs a malicious package via pip (either from PyPI or a direct source)"
  - "pip is configured to build packages from source (default behavior for packages without wheels)"
  - "No network egress filtering or endpoint detection in place"

mitigation:
  - "Use --only-binary :all: flag with pip to install pre-built wheels and avoid executing setup.py"
  - "Treat PEP 517/518 builds as a different execution path, not a safe one; review build backends and build dependencies before installing from source"
  - "Run pip install in isolated environments (containers, VMs, or sandboxed CI/CD runners)"
  - "Implement network egress filtering to block unexpected outbound connections during builds"
  - "Use pip's --require-hashes flag to verify package integrity against known-good hashes"
  - "Audit new and updated dependencies before installation using tools like pip-audit or safety"
  - "Use a private package index with curated and vetted packages"

      Updated the description and detection guidance to distinguish legacy
      setup.py execution from modern PEP 517/518 source-build behavior, and
      clarified that pyproject.toml does not by itself eliminate arbitrary
      build-time code execution. Sources:
