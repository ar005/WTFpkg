name: "setuptools cmdclass Command Override"
packageManager: "pip"
slug: "pip-cmdclass-override"
category: "Code Execution"
severity: "critical"
platform:
  - "Linux"
  - "macOS"
  - "Windows"
description: "The setuptools cmdclass parameter allows package authors to override built-in setup commands such as install, develop, egg_info, build_ext, and sdist by mapping them to custom Python classes. Attackers exploit this to inject malicious code that executes at specific stages of the pip lifecycle, including installation, development mode setup, and even metadata generation. This is more targeted than raw setup.py code execution because the attacker can hook into the exact phase of the build/install process that best suits their payload delivery, and the malicious class methods blend in with legitimate build customizations."
prerequisites:
  - "Victim installs the malicious package from source (not a pre-built wheel)"
  - "The package uses setuptools with a setup.py containing cmdclass overrides"
  - "pip executes the overridden command as part of the install lifecycle"
attackScenarios:
  - title: "Overriding the install command to execute payload"
    description: "The attacker subclasses setuptools' install command and overrides the run() method to inject malicious code that executes when the user runs pip install. The malicious run() method performs its payload before or after calling the parent class's run(), ensuring the installation completes normally to avoid suspicion."

mitigation:
  - "Install packages using --only-binary :all: to skip setup.py execution entirely"
  - "Audit cmdclass definitions in setup.py before installing any package from source"
  - "Use pip install --no-build-isolation cautiously; prefer isolated build environments"
  - "Treat PEP 517/518 builds as a different interface, not a trust boundary; arbitrary code can still run in build backends and build dependencies during source builds<sup><a href=\"#hist-1\">[1]</a></sup>"
  - "Implement code review policies for all new dependencies, focusing on setup.py and build scripts"
  - "Run package installations in containers or VMs with limited network access and filesystem permissions"
  - "Use tools like pip-audit to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies"

      Revised the mitigation guidance to clarify that moving from setup.py to
      pyproject.toml changes the build interface but does not by itself remove
      arbitrary build-time code execution risk. Source:
